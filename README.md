# To-Do List
Thanks for checking out my take on the classic To-Do list project.
## About
This project was completed as part of the ["Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

My to-do list, simply-named "Do.", is a lightweight way to keep track of projects and tasks. It features a simple user interface with few distractions getting in the way of a user's productivity.

## Technologies
"Do." was built with nothing but Vanilla JavaScript, some HTML, CSS, and some quality of life tools. As a new developer, deepening my understanding of the fundamentals is my greatest focus.
### Tools
This project relies on Webpack for bundling. Webpack allows me to break my code down into more concise modules and have my dependencies managed for me.  This being my second time using Webpack; I made a departure from the Webpack tutorials and utilized the command line tools for setup.
### Packages / Dependencies
I did include a couple of Node packages in this project for quality of life. These are:
* [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns)
* [simplebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplebar)
## Design Patterns and Techniques
Some of the new strategies used to complete this project are:
**Object Oriented Programming Principles**  
Used to create project & task Classes. Modifications to each item were handled by methods withing their respective classes.

## Challenges
This project met me with some challenges I had not faced before. These include:
* Breaking up code into concise modules, spanning across multiple documents
* Importing & exporting utilities from my modules
* Integrating SOLID principles  
    'Single Responsibility' Princliple
* Configuring tools such as Webpack, Es Lint, and Prettier
* Integrating Node Packages

## Installation
Clone the repository && Run `npm install`
